### OpenGL Barrel Distortion Shader for the Oculus Rift

Based on the basic version provided by Oculus VR, Inc. All copyright, etc. belongs to them.

*Note:* As of libovr 0.6 the distortion rendering is handled entirely by the compositing service, making the shaders in this repository entirely unnecessary. Do not expect to additional updates to support newer SDK versions.
